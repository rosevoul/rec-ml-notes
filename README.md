# Notes: Machine Learning and GenAI for Recommendation Systems

This repository contains applied notes and small experiments exploring selected methods
used in large-scale personalization and recommendation systems.

The focus is on understanding where different modeling approaches fit within
end-to-end ranking pipelines, their tradeoffs, and practical evaluation considerations.

Each section includes:
- A short conceptual overview
- A minimal illustrative example
- Notes on limitations and system-level implications
