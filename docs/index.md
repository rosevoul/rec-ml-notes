## About

I work on machine learning systems where modeling choices shape user experience, business outcomes, and long-term system behavior.

My focus is on:
- Translating abstract models into production-ready systems  
- Choosing the appropriate level of complexity for the problem  
- Making trade-offs, uncertainty, and failure modes explicit  

I’ve shipped end-to-end ML systems, from data pipelines and modeling to deployment, monitoring, and iteration, with direct ownership of production metrics. In recent work, I owned multiple production ML systems that drove measurable lift in engagement and tens of millions in incremental revenue.


## Areas of Interest

- Ranking, retrieval, and recommendation
- Representation learning at scale
- Offline and online evaluation
- ML infrastructure and lifecycle design
- Robustness, failure modes, and responsible ML
- Generative and agentic modeling in decision pipelines

## Metrics Showcases
- [Metrics Showcase: Churn-Driven Discount Allocation](notebooks/churn_discount_policy_decision.ipynb)  
  Using churn risk to decide which customers receive discounts. Focuses on decision policies, cost trade-offs, and expected value rather than model accuracy.

- [Metrics Showcase: Recommenders in Production (Retail)](notebooks/metrics_showcase_recommenders_production_retail.ipynb)  
  Choosing a Top-N ranking policy using business, user, and system metrics (CTR, EPM, diversity, freshness, latency) with explicit guardrails.

- [Metrics Showcase: Monitoring a Ranking Model in Production](notebooks/metrics_showcase_monitoring_ranking_model_production.ipynb)  
  Monitoring feature drift (PSI), target drift (CTR/CVR), and performance drift (AUC, calibration/value proxies) with explicit alert rules and drill-down diagnostics.
