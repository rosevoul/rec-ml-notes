## Perspective

I work on machine learning problems where modeling choices directly shape
user experience, business outcomes, and long-term system behavior.

My focus is on:
- Translating abstract models into production-ready systems  
- Choosing the appropriate level of complexity for the problem  
- Making tradeoffs, uncertainty, and failure modes explicit

## Areas of Interest

- Ranking, Retrieval, and Recommendation  
- Representation Learning at Scale  
- Offline and Online Evaluation  
- ML Infrastructure and Lifecycle Design  
- Responsible and Robust ML  
- Generative and Agentic Modeling

Each note pairs conceptual analysis with a minimal, reproducible artifact.

## Guiding Principle

Production ML is a decision system first and a modeling exercise second.
