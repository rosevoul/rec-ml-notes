## About

I work on machine learning systems where modeling choices shape user experience, business outcomes, and long-term system behavior.

My focus is on:
- Translating abstract models into production-ready systems  
- Choosing the appropriate level of complexity for the problem  
- Making trade-offs, uncertainty, and failure modes explicit  

I’ve shipped end-to-end ML systems, from data pipelines and modeling to deployment, monitoring, and iteration, with direct ownership of production metrics. In recent work, I owned multiple production ML systems that drove measurable lift in engagement and tens of millions in incremental revenue.

## Selected Technical Notes

1) **Recommender Embeddings: From Simple to Modern**
   - Co-occurrence and matrix factorization → item2vec → graph/network embeddings → multimodal embeddings.
   - Focus: when each method is appropriate, common failure modes, and how embeddings feed retrieval and ranking.
   - Notebook: [Embedding Methods for Recommenders](notebooks/recsys_embeddings.ipynb)

2) **Retrieval + Ranking, the Production Way**
   - Candidate generation (ANN/FAISS-style), two-tower retrieval, feature pipelines, pointwise vs pairwise losses, calibration, latency and throughput tradeoffs.
   - Focus: system boundaries, offline/online consistency, and safe iteration in production.
   - Notebook: [Production Retrieval & Ranking Pipeline](notebooks/retrieval_ranking_production.ipynb)

3) **Inference-Time Enhancements for Recommenders**
   - Reranking, query and item rewriting, hybrid scoring, structured outputs, caching, latency and cost controls, fallback logic.
   - Focus: inference-time pipeline steps that improve relevance without destabilizing the system.
   - Notebook: [Inference-Time Enhancements](notebooks/genai_recsys_inference.ipynb)

4) **Monitoring + Metrics for Recommenders**
   - Feature and target drift, segment health, ranking quality metrics, online monitoring, alerting, and incident triage.
   - Safeguards: policy checks, safety filters, and controlled fallback behavior.
   - Notebook: [Monitoring & Safeguards for Recommenders](notebooks/recsys_monitoring_guardrails.ipynb)
