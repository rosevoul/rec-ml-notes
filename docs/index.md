## About

I work on machine learning systems where modeling choices shape user experience, business outcomes, and long-term system behavior.

My focus is on:
- Translating abstract models into production-ready systems  
- Choosing the appropriate level of complexity for the problem  
- Making trade-offs, uncertainty, and failure modes explicit  

I’ve shipped end-to-end ML systems, from data pipelines and modeling to deployment, monitoring, and iteration, with direct ownership of production metrics. In recent work, I owned multiple production ML systems that drove measurable lift in engagement and tens of millions in incremental revenue.
