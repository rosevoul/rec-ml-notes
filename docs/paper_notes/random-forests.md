# Random Forests

Link: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf

Baseline-oriented reference.

Core properties:
- variance reduction through averaging
- robustness to noisy features
- minimal tuning required

Common usage pattern:

early-stage modeling.

Sequence:
- tabular data available
- mixed feature quality
- limited feature engineering

Outcome:
- strong baseline with little effort
- stable performance across splits

Interpretation risks:
feature importance ≠ causality  
importance unstable across correlated features  

Primary role:
signal check  
baseline floor
